# Crypto Arbitrage

This is a project that sorts through historical trade data, specifically the first three months of 2018, for Bitcoin on two different exchanges: Bitstamp and Coinbase. 
This Jupyter notebook contains the code for data collection, preparation, and analysis, including visualizations in order to determine if any arbitrage opportunities existed for Bitcoin in the first quarter 2018.

* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive 

* [%matplotlib inline](https://pythonguides.com/what-is-matplotlib-inline/) - can be used to enable the inline plotting, where the plots/graphs will be displayed just below the cell where your plotting commands are written
